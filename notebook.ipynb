    "\n",
    "This answer should be easy to get, surely, because Django is hosted on GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, yes, but more goes into a release of Django than just GitHub. There's also the separate ticketing system, Trac, and translations from Transifex, just to name two of the major systems involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "`django/django` also uses an interesting way of cutting releases, as described in [Carlton's notes](https://noumenal.es/posts/what-is-django-4/zj2/) from when he tried to answer this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a more complete view of the information, we need to get data from a few systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start: which version do we want to get the information for? In this case, 4.1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Noting of course that this data may still be in flux as this is still the current minor version, and will still have data changes until it is EOL'd some time in 2023 or there abouts. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's also the information just in the comments themselves: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The author and the committer (not always the same person)\n",
    "* The Trac issue (often in the comment message itself)\n",
    "* Any manual thanks (often in the case of security fixes) as part of the message\n",
    "* Any discussions in attached pull requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "And from there, the Trac data, particularly the discussions in the ticket itself. But here, a ticket may have been opened longer than the release window, so why don't we initially limit this to comments on the ticket since the release was branched off. \n",
    "\n",
    "And also adding the same sort of data about commits in the branch from `django/django-docs-translations`, where the contributors are in the commit itself. \n",
